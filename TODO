TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. The debug_backtrace() does not show information about arrays type.

2. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if variable is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.

3. It is impossible to assign {1, 2, 3} to float[], because in fact we are trying to assign int[] to float[].
