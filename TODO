TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. The debug_backtrace() does not show information about arrays type.
 * This is caused by ph7_context_new_array() creating a generic array w/o data type set.
   Most probably more builtin functions returning an array are affected.

2. All builtin functions should be reworked. Actually they can return any value, sometimes of different type than declared.
   This causes errors during script execution.

3. Callback variable type is broken.
 * Builtin functions expect a string or hashmap instead of callback, thus closures are not executed at all.
 * Callback takes a string with function name or closure definition. How to call other methods?
