TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $f; $f[] = 4; causes segmentation fault.

2. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

3. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

4. Closures and methods declaration / definition uses function keyword.
