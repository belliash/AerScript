TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. 'array()' keyword and builtin function is no longer needed and should be removed.

2. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if variable is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.

3. Arrays in AerScript are of incompatible type and can be assigned only to mixed variable type. This should be fixed.

4. Arrays can be assigned to non-array variable, argument to Program::main is affected as well.
	int main(string[] $args); is valid, but int main(string $args); also works

5. Array construct '{ ... }' should check if all elements are of the same type and set it as whole array type or failover to mixed.
