TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

2. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

3. Methods declaration / definition still uses function keyword.

4. PH7_OP_DONE operator should check if return value match the data type of declared method/closure.

5. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if varaible is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.
