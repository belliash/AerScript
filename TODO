TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

2. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if variable is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.

3. Interpreter does not check, if all methods from interface being implemented are defined in class.

4. object $x = new OOP(); fails with 'Return with a value in closure/method returning void'

5. Accessing private attribute from parent class fails with 'Undefined class attribute' instead of error about visibility.

6. Interpreter does not check if all methods match their signatures from interfaces and virtual classes.
