TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

2. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

3. Methods declaration / definition still uses function keyword.

4. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if varaible is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.

5. Interpreter should verify that Program::main() returns a value of int or void data type.
