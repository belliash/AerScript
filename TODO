TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. 'array()' keyword and builtin function is no longer needed and should be removed.

2. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if variable is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.
