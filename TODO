TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

2. CHAR data type do not allow assignment of integer values in range of 0-255 inclusively as well as strings of 1-character length.

3. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

4. Closures and methods declaration / definition uses function keyword.
