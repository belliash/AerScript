TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. 'array()' keyword and builtin function is no longer needed and should be removed.

2. Some builtin functions like isset() seems to be useless, if variable is not defined, interpreter will throw an error.

3. Arrays can be assigned to non-array method argument to Program::main is affected as well.
	int main(string[] $args); is valid, but int main(string $args); also works
