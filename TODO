TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. mixed[] $arr = array(5, '5');
	var_dump shows some trash information about $arr variable.

2. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

3. Data types like char or void are still not supported.

4. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

5. Closures and methods declaration / definition uses function keyword.
