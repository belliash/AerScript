TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. The debug_backtrace() does not show information about arrays type.

2. Array get a type of mixed, if there are at least 2 different types of value specified, even they are compatible, eg.
	{4, 5.5} will result in mixed instead of float.
