TODO list for typehinting branch.
Below list contains things that should be changed/fixed/implemented.


1. int[] $arr = {5, 5};
	This syntax is unsupported yet. Should replace the array() function.

2. CHAR data type do not allow assignment of integer values in range of 0-255 inclusively as well as strings of 1-character length.

3. FLOAT data type do not allow assignment of integer values. In this case INT value should be automatically typecasted to FLOAT.

4. Class properties do not support strict data type hinting.

5. Closures and methods declaration / definition uses function keyword.
