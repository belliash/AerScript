## P# Interpreter
P# is an Open Source general-purpose object-oriented scripting language especially suited for embedded environments
as well as web development, that implements a highly-efficient bytecode compiler and a virtual machine. Its syntax
draws upon C#, Java and PHP.

P# is the ideal language interpreter for writing enhanced web applications like blog, CMS, search engine, etc. or
embedded solutions with dynamic web interfaces like routers, set-top-boxes, or smart home solutions. P# Interpreter
is based on PH7 Engine and thus it is 100% hand-coded, written in pure C software, that compiles unmodified and runs
on any platform including restricted embedded device with a C compiler.
